# Cancer Detection App

A mobile application for detecting cancer using Machine Learning, developed as a submission for Dicoding. This app leverages TensorFlow Lite for real-time image classification and integrates additional features to enhance user experience and functionality.

## üöÄ **Features**
1. **Image Selection and Preview**
   - Users can upload images from their gallery, which are previewed within the app.

2. **Cancer Detection with TensorFlow Lite**
   - Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to predict whether an image indicates cancer.
   - Provides a confidence score for the prediction.

3. **Prediction Results**
   - Displays:
     - Diagnosis: Indicates whether the image suggests cancer or not.
     - Confidence Score: A numeric value representing the model's prediction accuracy.
   - Handles errors gracefully with appropriate messages.

4. **Health News Integration**
   - Fetches and displays relevant health news articles, including those about cancer, using the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

5. **Enhanced Usability**
   - Features for cropping and rotating images (powered by uCrop) to ensure better results during analysis.
   - Saves prediction history locally, including images, results, and confidence scores, for user reference.
